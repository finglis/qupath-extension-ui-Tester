# QuPath User Interface Testing Extension

The purpose of this extension is to provide a quick way to view the QuPath user interface and test out different settings. 
This removes the need to search through the features to find the one you want to test. 
Ideally this extension will contain each component used within QuPath, but for now it will try to contain the most frequently used ones.

## Installation
To Install this extension within QuPath, drag and drop the .jar file into the QuPath window. 
The jar can be found within the build/libs folder.
